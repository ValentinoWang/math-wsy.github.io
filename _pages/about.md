Biography
---
I'm Siyao, an undergraduate student in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. 
I have a wide range of interests in statistics, data science, and mathematical modeling with interdisciplinary backgrounds, 
and I want to search for creative inspiration within the intersection of knowledge in different areas.

Moreover, I want to explore different areas worldwide and experience different cultural surroundings that can't be read from books.
Then after experiencing the collision of different cultures, I would be wiser in the face of tricky questions.

My undergraduate education supports my solid foundation in mathematics and equips me with clear mathematical logic.
I am grateful to many professors that have ever supported me. Not only knowledge, but they give me the enthusiasm to describe natural phenomena from a mathematical perspective.
