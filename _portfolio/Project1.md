* Determined the ideal paraboloid position of the “FAST” active reflector panels in the operating state using space analytic geometry, according to the spherical position in the idle state

* Derived the actual working paraboloid position by constructing the target planning model under the constraints of the cable nodes’ adjustment range on the panels; Invoked particle swarm algorithm to solve the model、

* Applied the model to observe celestial body at a particular location and calculated the ratio of the reflected signal to the received signal of the receivers
