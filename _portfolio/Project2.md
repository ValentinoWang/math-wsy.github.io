* Fitted the power profiles (indicates how long a rider can produce a given amount of power) for different types of cyclists using the hyperbolic model after a thorough review of the literature on kinematics physics to characterize their unique ability
 Derived the ordinary differential equations for cyclists‚Äô power and riding velocity from the dynamic analysis of cyclists

* Developed and solved a planning model targeting the shortest time for 2021 Tokyo Olympic Time Trial course under the constraints of sharp turns velocity and sprint limits

* Tested the robustness and stability of the model by adding the influence of $\pm3ùëö/s$ wind velocity as well as calculating the time taken for the power distribution to deviate 10% from the ideal model

* Applied the model to team cycling races to analyze the time used in different team synergy modes
