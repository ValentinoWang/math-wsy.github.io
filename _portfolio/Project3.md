* For the data processing part, the team first used the geographic flow map, stratified area map, and circle stacking map to visualize the spatial distribution, gender, and age composition of the sample, in order to make a holistic analysis of the sample data and to analyze the scientific validity of the sample data in the research report.

* We then used a composite pie chart to initially explore the sample's knowledge of the characteristics of hybrid rice and then used the Spearman ordinal correlation coefficient to analyze the correlation between the sample's education and the sample's knowledge of the different characteristics of hybrid rice, and formed a correlation coefficient matrix. The correlation coefficients were tested for significance. Finally, the findings of the correlation coefficient matrix were analyzed. It was concluded that there was no significant correlation between the sample's education and the sample's knowledge of hybrid rice's own characteristics.

* Then, we determined the order value of each response according to the ranking of the responses and combined the two synonymous questions to jointly reflect the public's perception of the market demand for hybrid rice, and then used market demand, commercialization, and economic status as the three dimensions. Then, the three dimensions of market need - commercialization - economic status are used as the three dimensions, and a three-dimensional scatter plot is constructed by combining the sample ordinal values with uniform distribution as the error term. Finally, the conclusion that the public is interested in the above three components: not interested = 566:298 ≈ 1.899 is obtained.

* Finally, a Sankey diagram was used to visualize the correlation between sample education and sample perceptions of hybrid rice and national development, and the conclusion that there was no significant correlation between sample education and sample perceptions of hybrid rice and national development was obtained.
