The SIS model with migration relationship between two patches was developed by considering vaccination as a constant covariate group and 
a pulse vaccination factor. 
The disease-free cycle solution was obtained by solving for the number of vaccinations at the end of the cycle at the moment of disease-free equilibrium, plotted using Matlab software when the migration rate was taken as a constant in both patches. 
Then, the conditions for the disease-free cycle solution to satisfy stability within a positive cycle were explored. The conditions for the simultaneous stability of the disease-free cycle solution at both locations were given so that the inequality of the relationship between the maximum value of the minimum inoculation positive cycle and the migration coefficient could be derived when other parameters were determined.
