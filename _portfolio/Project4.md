* Proposed the SIVS model of two cities by adding the effects of periodic pulse inoculation and population migration to the traditional SIR model

* Obtained and visualized the numerical solution of the equation using MATLAB; divided the solutions into “disease-free equilibrium” and “endemic equilibrium” according to whether the disease will be extinct in the stable state

* Found the analytic solution for disease-free equilibrium; analyzed its stability using Lyapunov’s second theorem

* Predicted the disease trends based on the model; provided practical strategy on the prevention and control of the disease
